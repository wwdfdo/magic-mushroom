        A group of friends went camping in the Magic Forest to see what secrets
        they could uncover. The glow of the full moon drew their attention to a
        field of colorful mushrooms under a canopy of trees. They ate the
        deliciously colored mushrooms and were instantly transported from the
        Magic Forest to a new realm, the biotic metaverse. The friends found the
        mushrooms held magical properties as they took a look at each other and
        realized their bodies had slowly morphed into mushrooms - thus creating
        the Magic Mushroom Clubhouse. They now embark on adventures to spread
        the ancient powers of mushrooms, discover the secrets of their ancestors
        and help others along the way!
